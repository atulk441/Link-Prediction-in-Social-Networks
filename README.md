# Link-Prediction-in-Social-Networks

## Abstract: 
In this paper, our aim is to analyze the structure of social networks and compute the different kinds of scores between any nodes in the network. We’ll begin by discussing some background of the problem statement. Then we will provide an overview of the methods that have been considered for calculating the similarity between any nodes in the social network. Once computed, we will then focus on the implementation of the
Machine Learning models, where we will be training and testing our different models on the computed similarity scores. Finally, we will then analyze how effective our model is to predict future links in the social network by calculating several performance measures.

## Results Highlights:
• All models perform exceptionally well on all datasets while training, achieving accuracies of 95% or higher. 
• The models achieved close to 90% accuracy for the Epinions test set and above 95% accuracy on the test sets for the other two datasets, with one dataset reaching an exceptional 99% accuracy.
• All models demonstrate high precision rates approaching 100% across multiple datasets. However, the Epinions dataset shows lowest recall rate (close to 85%) among three datasets.
